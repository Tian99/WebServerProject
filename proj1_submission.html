<h1>Project 1 Submission Instructions</h1>

<p>Make sure you include all of the files you modified in your submission. At minimum this
should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>http_client.c</li>
<li>http_server1.c</li>
<li>http_server2.c</li>
<li>http_server3.c</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should also include a README file that lists the full names, email addresses, and
usernames for each group member. After that, it should specify what files are included and
any special steps that are needed to compile them. The README should also specify
what is and what is not working in your project. Also please include anything else you
would like us to know and/or consider during the grading process.
</p>

<p>
To actually submit the project, create a directory named <username>-proj1, where
<username> is one of the group member’s (it doesn’t matter which one) Pitt usernames.
Then copy all of the files you will be submitting into that directory, and create a tar archive
of that directory: tar -czf <username>-proj1.tar.gz <username>-proj1
</p>

<p>
Finally email the tar archive as an attachment to the TA. The subject line of the
email should include the last names of the group members and “Project 1"
